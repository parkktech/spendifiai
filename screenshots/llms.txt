## Core Features

### AI Transaction Categorization
Transactions are automatically categorized using Claude AI with confidence scoring:
- 85%+ confidence: auto-categorized silently
- 60-84%: categorized but flagged for review
- 40-59%: generates multiple-choice question for user
- Below 40%: generates open-ended question
The AI learns from your corrections and improves over time.

### Subscription Detection & Tracking
Scans transaction history for recurring charge patterns (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual). Identifies unused subscriptions using frequency-based gap analysis (2x billing cycle without activity = flagged as unused). Shows annual cost and helps you cancel wasteful charges.

### AI Savings Recommendations
Analyzes 90 days of spending history to generate personalized savings recommendations with specific action steps, projected monthly savings, and cheaper alternatives for subscriptions and services.

### Tax Deduction Tracking & Export
Maps all categorized expenses to IRS Schedule C lines. Exports comprehensive tax package:
- Excel workbook with 5 detailed tabs
- PDF summary cover sheet for accountants
- CSV backup file
Can email the package directly to your accountant.

### Bank Statement Upload
Upload PDF or CSV bank statements as an alternative to Plaid bank sync. AI extracts transactions from statements with duplicate detection. Supports all major banks.

### Budget Waterfall Dashboard
Visual breakdown of income vs expenses with interactive charts, monthly bill tracking, home affordability calculator, and "where to cut" spending analysis.

### Business/Personal Expense Separation
Tag bank accounts as personal, business, mixed, or investment. Purpose cascades to all transactions for accurate categorization and tax deduction identification.

### Email Receipt Matching
Connect Gmail or IMAP email to automatically match receipt emails with bank transactions. AI parses receipt details for enhanced categorization.
