================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

LedgerIQ is a free, AI-powered personal finance platform that helps
individuals, freelancers, and small business owners take complete control of
their financial lives. By combining bank-grade security, intelligent
automation, and the power of Claude AI, LedgerIQ eliminates the tedious
manual work of expense tracking, subscription management, savings
optimization, and tax preparation.

Unlike competitors that charge $8-15/month (Mint, YNAB, Copilot), LedgerIQ
is 100% free with no premium tiers, no trial periods, and no credit card
required. This is not a loss leader - it is a deliberate strategy to capture
market share in the rapidly growing personal finance management sector.


CORE VALUE PROPOSITIONS
-----------------------

  * Automatic AI Categorization - Claude AI categorizes every transaction
    with 85%+ accuracy, learns from corrections, and cascades intelligence
    across merchants

  * Bank Connectivity - Secure Plaid integration (12,000+ institutions,
    SOC 2 Type II) plus manual statement upload for banks not on Plaid

  * Subscription Detection - Pattern-based detection of all recurring
    charges, with "stopped billing" alerts for unused services

  * AI Savings Recommendations - Personalized, actionable plans based on
    90 days of real spending data, prioritized by ease of implementation

  * Tax Deduction Optimization - Automatic IRS Schedule C mapping with
    one-click export (Excel, PDF, CSV) and email-to-accountant

  * Comprehensive Dashboard - 8-widget financial command center: budget
    waterfall, monthly bills, home affordability, where to cut, savings
    tracking, and more


TECHNOLOGY STACK
----------------

Built on Laravel 12 (PHP 8.3), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4,
PostgreSQL, and Redis. AI powered by Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4. Bank
integration via Plaid API. 142 automated tests ensure reliability across
all features.


================================================================================
BANK CONNECTIVITY & DATA INGESTION
================================================================================

LedgerIQ provides two complementary methods for importing financial data,
ensuring every user can participate regardless of their bank or technical
comfort level.


PLAID BANK INTEGRATION
-----------------------

Through Plaid - the same infrastructure trusted by Venmo, Robinhood,
Coinbase, and thousands of financial applications - users can securely
connect their bank accounts in under 60 seconds. Their banking credentials
never touch LedgerIQ's servers.

How It Works:

  * User clicks "Connect Bank" and authenticates directly with their bank
    through Plaid's secure modal
  * Plaid returns an encrypted access token - LedgerIQ stores it with
    AES-256 encryption at rest
  * Transactions sync automatically in real-time via webhooks
  * Account balances, types, and metadata are imported alongside transactions
  * Users can disconnect at any time with one click - the encrypted token
    is immediately destroyed

Security Credentials:

  * SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure
  * End-to-end TLS encryption for all data in transit
  * Plaid access tokens encrypted with AES-256 at rest in PostgreSQL
  * Webhook signature verification prevents tampering
  * Idempotency logging prevents duplicate transaction processing

Multi-Account Support:

Users can link multiple banks and multiple account types (checking, savings,
credit card, investment). Each account can be tagged with a purpose -
personal, business, mixed, or investment - which becomes the strongest
signal for AI categorization accuracy.


BANK STATEMENT UPLOAD
---------------------

For users whose banks are not supported by Plaid, or who prefer not to link
their accounts electronically, LedgerIQ offers intelligent statement parsing.
Users simply upload a PDF or CSV bank statement, and Claude AI extracts every
transaction automatically.

PDF Statement Processing:

  * User uploads a PDF bank statement (up to 10 MB)
  * The system extracts raw text using spatie/pdf-to-text (pdftotext binary)
  * Extracted text is sent to Claude AI with context about the bank name
    and account type
  * AI identifies and extracts each transaction: date, description, amount,
    deposit/withdrawal
  * Merchant names are cleaned - card numbers, reference IDs, and city/state
    suffixes are stripped
  * Example: "AMAZON.COM*RT3K2 AMZN.COM/BIL WA" becomes "Amazon"

CSV Statement Processing:

  * User uploads a CSV file from any bank
  * System reads the first 5 rows and sends them to Claude AI for column
    detection
  * AI identifies which columns contain the date, description, amount (or
    separate debit/credit), and balance
  * AI determines the date format and number of header rows to skip
  * The entire CSV is then parsed using the detected column mapping
  * This approach works with any CSV format from any institution - no
    pre-configured templates needed

Duplicate Detection:

Before importing, LedgerIQ automatically checks each parsed transaction
against existing records. Matches are identified using amount (within $0.01
tolerance), date (exact match), and merchant name (Levenshtein distance
threshold). Flagged duplicates are shown to the user for review before
import, preventing double-counting.

Post-Import Pipeline:

After the user reviews and confirms the parsed transactions, they are
imported into the same pipeline as Plaid transactions. The AI categorization
engine processes them identically - there is no second-class treatment for
uploaded data.


================================================================================
AI-POWERED TRANSACTION CATEGORIZATION
================================================================================

At the heart of LedgerIQ is Claude AI's ability to understand and categorize
financial transactions with human-like accuracy. This is not simple keyword
matching - the AI considers context, account purpose, merchant patterns, and
user history to make intelligent decisions.


WHAT THE AI CONSIDERS
---------------------

  * Merchant name and normalized merchant identifier
  * Transaction amount and date
  * Description and payment channel (card, ACH, wire, etc.)
  * Plaid's baseline automated category (when available)
  * Account purpose: personal, business, mixed, or investment - the single
    strongest categorization signal
  * Account nickname (e.g., "Business Checking" provides strong context)
  * User's employment type (W-2, self-employed, freelancer)
  * Business type and home office status
  * Tax filing status and custom categorization rules


CONFIDENCE-BASED ROUTING
-------------------------

The AI assigns a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) to every categorization.
This score determines the user experience:

  Confidence   | Action            | User Experience
  -------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------
  85%+         | Auto-categorize   | Silently categorized. User sees it done.
  60-84%       | Flag for review   | Category applied, marked for verification.
  40-59%       | Multiple-choice   | AI generates 3-4 options for user to pick.
  Below 40%    | Open-ended Q      | AI asks free-text; user can chat back.


LEARNING FROM CORRECTIONS
--------------------------

When a user corrects a categorization or answers an AI question, the system
doesn't just update that one transaction:

  * The correction is applied to the target transaction immediately
  * All other transactions from the same merchant are updated to match
    (unless already user-confirmed)
  * Pending AI questions for the same merchant are automatically resolved
  * Future transactions from that merchant inherit the user's preference
  * This "cascade" behavior means answering one question can resolve dozens
    of transactions simultaneously


56 EXPENSE CATEGORIES
---------------------

LedgerIQ uses 56 expense categories (46 top-level, 10 subcategories)
organized into logical groups: Housing & Utilities, Transportation, Food &
Dining, Business Expenses, Personal & Health, Subscriptions & Entertainment,
Household & Personal, Education & Wealth, and Transfer/Income categories.
Of these, 12 categories have direct IRS Schedule C line mappings for tax
export.


AI QUESTION TYPES
-----------------

  * Category     - "What category best describes this $47.99 charge at COSTCO?"
  * Bus/Personal - "Is this $129 charge at Staples for business or personal?"
  * Split        - "Was this $200 Costco purchase all groceries, or mixed?"
  * Confirm      - "Is this $15.99 charge correctly categorized as Streaming?"


================================================================================
SUBSCRIPTION DETECTION & MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

The average American spends $219/month on subscriptions, with studies showing
that most people underestimate their recurring charges by 2-3x. LedgerIQ's
Subscription Detective scans 6 months of transaction history to surface every
recurring charge - especially the ones users have forgotten about.


DETECTION ALGORITHM
-------------------

  * All transactions from the past 6 months are grouped by normalized
    merchant name
  * Merchants with 2+ transactions are analyzed for recurrence patterns
  * The system measures intervals between charges and checks amount
    consistency (within 20% tolerance)
  * Charges are classified by frequency: weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual
  * A pre-populated registry of 49 known subscription merchants enhances
    accuracy


"STOPPED BILLING" DETECTION - FINDING UNUSED SUBSCRIPTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is where LedgerIQ provides immediate, concrete value. The system
compares each subscription's last charge date against its expected billing
cycle:

  Frequency  | Flagged As Unused After         | Logic
  -----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------
  Weekly     | 21+ days without a charge       | 3x the weekly interval
  Monthly    | 60+ days without a charge       | 2x the monthly interval
  Quarterly  | 180+ days without a charge      | 2x the quarterly interval
  Annual     | 400+ days without a charge      | ~13 months since last charge

When a subscription is flagged as "stopped billing," it receives a prominent
red badge on both the Subscriptions page and the Dashboard's monthly bills
widget. This immediately draws the user's attention to services they may be
paying for but not using.


USER RESPONSE SYSTEM
--------------------

For each subscription, users can take one of three actions:

  * Cancel - Mark the subscription for cancellation. LedgerIQ provides
    direct links to cancellation pages and tracks the projected savings.
  * Reduce - Downgrade to a cheaper plan. The AI suggests alternative tiers
    and calculates the savings difference.
  * Keep - Acknowledge the subscription and dismiss the alert. This prevents
    future nagging about services the user values.


AI-POWERED ALTERNATIVES
-----------------------

When a user considers canceling or reducing a subscription, LedgerIQ's AI
can suggest cheaper alternatives. For example, if a user is paying
$15.99/month for a streaming service, the AI might suggest a competitor at
$7.99/month or a bundle that combines multiple services for less. Alternative
suggestions are cached for 7 days to minimize API calls.


================================================================================
AI SAVINGS RECOMMENDATIONS & GOAL TRACKING
================================================================================

LedgerIQ's savings engine goes beyond simple "spend less" advice. It analyzes
90 days of actual spending data - broken down by category, merchant, timing,
and pattern - to generate specific, actionable recommendations with real
dollar amounts pulled from the user's own transactions.


90-DAY SPENDING ANALYSIS
-------------------------

The AI receives a comprehensive spending profile including:

  * Total spending by category with transaction counts and averages
  * Active and unused subscriptions with monthly costs
  * Daily spending averages and day-of-week patterns
  * Impulse purchase frequency (transactions under $20)
  * Dining out frequency and totals
  * Late-night purchasing patterns (potential impulse indicator)
  * Total transaction volume for context


RECOMMENDATION QUALITY
-----------------------

Each AI recommendation includes:

  Field             | Description
  ------------------|----------------------------------------------------
  Title             | Short, actionable headline (e.g., "Cancel Paramount+
                    | and Crunchyroll")
  Description       | Specific explanation using REAL merchant names and
                    | amounts from user data
  Monthly Savings   | Estimated monthly dollar savings
  Annual Savings    | Projected annual impact (monthly x 12)
  Difficulty        | Easy (no lifestyle change), Medium (behavior change),
                    | Hard (sacrifice)
  Impact            | High ($50+/mo), Medium ($15-50/mo), Low (under $15)
  Action Steps      | Numbered instructions (e.g., "Go to
                    | paramountplus.com/account, click Cancel")
  Related Merchants | The specific merchants this recommendation affects


SAVINGS GOAL PLANNING
---------------------

Users can set a concrete savings target (e.g., "Save $500/month for an
emergency fund by December"). The AI then generates a personalized action
plan:

  * Calculates the gap between current spending and the savings target
  * Prioritizes easy wins first (unused subscriptions, plan downgrades)
  * Then targets discretionary spending (dining, entertainment, impulse)
  * Only suggests cutting essentials as a last resort, with clear warnings
  * Each action includes specific "how-to" steps using real merchants
  * Actions are priority-ordered (1 = do first) for maximum impact
  * Progress is tracked with a visual progress bar and on-track indicators


RESPONSE & TRACKING SYSTEM
---------------------------

For each recommendation, users can respond with Cancel (they'll stop the
service), Reduce (they'll downgrade), or Keep (they value it). Responses are
tracked over time, and the projected savings banner updates in real-time as
users commit to changes. Monthly pulse checks compare actual spending against
commitments.


================================================================================
TAX DEDUCTION OPTIMIZATION & EXPORT
================================================================================

For freelancers, self-employed individuals, and small business owners, tax
deduction tracking is one of LedgerIQ's most valuable features. The AI
automatically identifies tax-deductible expenses and maps them to IRS
Schedule C line items, then exports accountant-ready reports in multiple
formats.


AUTOMATIC TAX DEDUCTIBILITY DETECTION
--------------------------------------

During categorization, Claude AI evaluates each transaction for tax
deductibility based on the user's employment type and the expense category.

Self-Employed / Freelancer Deductions:

  * Office supplies and equipment
  * Software and SaaS subscriptions used for business
  * Business meals (50% deductible per IRS rules)
  * Home office expenses
  * Professional development and training
  * Business travel (flights, hotels, transportation)
  * Marketing and advertising
  * Health insurance premiums (self-employed deduction)
  * Professional services (legal, accounting)
  * Shipping and postage

Universal Deductions:

  * Charitable donations (Schedule A)
  * Medical expenses above AGI threshold (Schedule A)
  * Mortgage interest (Schedule A)
  * State and local taxes - SALT (Schedule A)


IRS SCHEDULE C LINE MAPPING
----------------------------

LedgerIQ maps 12 expense categories directly to IRS Schedule C lines:

  Schedule C Line | Description         | LedgerIQ Categories
  ----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------

SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

LedgerIQ treats security as a foundational requirement, not an afterthought.
The platform implements defense-in-depth across every layer of the stack.


ENCRYPTION
----------

  * AES-256 encryption at rest for all sensitive data (Plaid tokens, bank
    account EINs, email credentials, 2FA secrets, transaction metadata)
  * Laravel model-level encryption casts - sensitive fields are never
    stored in plaintext
  * TLS/HTTPS for all data in transit
  * HSTS header with 1-year max-age, includeSubDomains, and preload


AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL
--------------------------------

  * bcrypt password hashing (Laravel default)
  * Sanctum bearer token authentication for API endpoints
  * Rate limiting on all authentication endpoints
  * Optional TOTP two-factor authentication with encrypted backup codes
  * Google OAuth social login as an alternative
  * Password reset via signed email links
  * Email verification for new accounts
  * Account lockout protection after failed attempts


SECURITY HEADERS
----------------

  * Content-Security-Policy - Restricts script, style, font, image, and
    frame sources
  * X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - Prevents MIME-type sniffing
  * X-Frame-Options: DENY - Prevents clickjacking
  * Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  * Permissions-Policy - Disables camera, microphone, geolocation
  * Strict-Transport-Security - Forces HTTPS with preload


DATA PROTECTION
---------------

  * Every model with sensitive data uses $hidden arrays to prevent API leak
  * Plaid access tokens encrypted and never exposed to the frontend
  * Webhook signature verification prevents request tampering
  * Idempotency logging prevents duplicate webhook processing
  * Users can disconnect banks and delete accounts at any time


================================================================================
ADDITIONAL FEATURES
================================================================================

Email Receipt Parsing (In Development):

Users can connect their Gmail (via OAuth) or any IMAP email account.
LedgerIQ scans for order confirmations and receipts, extracts product-level
detail using Claude AI, and matches them to bank transactions. This provides
itemized purchase tracking - for example, knowing that a $147.32 Amazon
charge was specifically for office supplies and a printer cartridge, enabling
more accurate tax categorization at the product level.

AI Question Chat System:

When the AI is uncertain about a transaction's category, it asks the user.
Users interact through a dedicated Questions page where they can answer
multiple-choice questions, provide free-text explanations, or engage in a
back-and-forth chat with the AI for nuanced situations. Bulk answer mode
lets users resolve multiple questions at once.

Transaction Management:

A full-featured transaction table with filtering by date range, category,
amount range, merchant, account, and review status. Users can inline-edit
categories and mark transactions as deductible. Eight query scopes provide
efficient data retrieval across the application.

Financial Profile & Settings:

Users can configure their employment type, business type, home office
status, tax filing status, and income details. This profile data enhances
AI categorization accuracy and tax deduction detection. Settings also
include 2FA management and account deletion.


================================================================================
